# CoinTrackerProject
Please see Notion https://cointracker.notion.site/Nitin-Chandra-fa9ebaf0da294d16a5363d52b7b74f4f for details on the overall system design.

# Running the Project
1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to the directory where the project is located
3. Make sure you are using python3
4. Install the requests library using 'pip3 install requests'
6. Run the project using 'python3 coin_tracker_assignment.py'

Please note that the API calls to Blockchair take a few extra seconds to run so I would give the whole program 30 seconds to run just to be safe
